ircd-ratbox (2.2.9-3) jessie-wikimedia; urgency=medium

  * Declare a package conflict with whois: ircd-ratbox ships
    /usr/bin/mkpasswd (same as whois). The same is already true for
    the ircd-ratbox package used on argon. If ircd-ratbox were still
    in the Debian archive, the proper way would be to rename the
    binary, but in this case simply conflicting with whois is also fine.
